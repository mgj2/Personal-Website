# Personal-Website

This is a personal website built by Miles Johnson for Portland State University course CS 410 Introduction to Web Development.

## Resources

Code for the dynamic "Scroll to top" button was adapted from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_scroll_to_top.asp.
Javascript code for building the expandable hamburger menu was adapted from YouTube content creator Cem Eygi Media at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh36Kts-wX8. The menu can be observed when viewing the website on a screen smaller than 480 pixels wide.
The guides at css-tricks.com for flexbox and grid were also used to build the "courses" and "projects" sections.

## Running the code

This repo can be run by visiting url https://www.mgj2.github.io/Personal-Website. Javascript for the "scroll to top" button can be observed by scrolling down on the page.
